# SG-MRT-BFS
Shortest path between 2 Singapore MRT stations using Breadth-First-Search

recently started learning graph theory, and thought this project might be fun.

its kinda shit cus it the edges aren't weighted, and time transfering between different lines aren't considered, but I still think its kinda cool

python is so bad
i wasted like 3 hours wondering why adjacency list were filled with a bunch of nodes that weren't connected

turns out defining lists like `adjlist = [[]]*N` actually makes it so every single inner list copies each other.

but reading files using c++ is so complicated );

list of mrt stations was taken and edited from https://github.com/xkjyeah/singapore-postal-codes/
